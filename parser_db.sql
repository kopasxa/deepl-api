The counter-attacks galvanized Ukraine’s Western backers and caused anger in Russia, which has time and again been stymied in its full-scale assault of its neighboring state that it launched seven months ago.\n“Our country also has various means of destruction and in some components more modern than those of the NATO countries, and if the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people,” Putin said in his speech Wednesday indicating a possible new chapter in the months-long conflict.\nRussian mercenaries bombard Bakhmut as Moscow searches for a win\nAddressing the potential for escalation and use of nuclear weapons, Putin said: “Those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the prevailing winds can turn in their direction.”\nThe announcement comes as Russia is believed to face shortages of manpower and follows amendments to Russia’s law on military service made Tuesday, which raise the penalties for resistance related to military service or coercion to violate an official military order during a period of mobilization or martial law.\nPutin framed the ongoing fighting as part of a larger struggle for Russian survival against a West whose goal is it is to “weaken, divide and ultimately destroy our country.” Several Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine announced that they will hold referendums on formally joining Russia this week, votes that have widely been dismissed as shams intended to boost Putin’s justifications for further attacks on Ukrainian territory.\n“They are already saying directly that they were able to split the Soviet Union in 1991 and now the time has come for Russia to break up into a multitude of regions and areas which are fatally hostile to each other,” Putin said.\nBut NATO leaders dismissed the announcement as a sign of panic in the Kremlin, and reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Ukraine’s military.\n“No amount of threats and propaganda can hide the fact that Ukraine is winning this war, the international community are united and Russia is becoming a global pariah,” British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Wednesday.\nReferendums announced\nThe referendums, which Putin backed during his speech Wednesday, could pave the way for Russian annexation of the areas, allowing Moscow to frame the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive there as an attack on Russia itself, thereby providing Moscow with a pretext to escalate its military response.\nIn what appeared to be a coordinated announcement, Russian-appointed leaders in the occupied regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia and the self-declared Luhansk People’s Republic and Donetsk People’s Republic all said they planned to hold “votes” beginning on September 23.\nTogether the four regions that have announced their referendum plans make up around 18% of Ukraine’s territory. Russia does not control any of the four in their entirety.\nThe expected referendums, which run counter to international law upholding Ukraine’s sovereignty, have been announced as world leaders have descended on New York for a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, where the war and it impacts were already poised to loom large.\nUkraine has dismissed the announcement of referendums in the occupied regions as a “sham” stemming from the “fear of defeat,” while the the country’s Western supporters signaled they would not alter their support for Ukraine.\nUS Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget A. Brink wrote on Twitter Wednesday that “sham referenda and mobilization are signs of weakness, of Russian failure. The United States will never recognize Russia’s claim to purportedly annexed Ukrainian territory, and we will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.”\nPutin on Wednesday said Russia has been asked for support from the two “people’s republics” and the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia for the referendums and had pledged to do “everything to ensure the safe conditions for people to express their will.”\nPotential for escalation\nThe announcements had already received swift support from Russian politicians. Former Russian President and vice-chairman of Russia’s National Security Council Dmitry Medvedev has publicly endorsed referendums in the self-declared Donbas republics, saying this would have “huge significance” for “systemic protection” of the residents.\n“Encroachment on Russian territory is a crime which allows you to use all the forces of self-defense,” Medvedev said on his Telegram channel, in an apparent allusion to the potential for the military escalation.\nIt’s unclear what form an escalation could take, but concerns have been raised throughout the conflict over whether Russia would resort to using its nuclear stockpile in the Ukraine.\nUS President Joe Biden addressed these concerns in a 60 Minutes interview earlier this week, when a reporter asked what he would say to the Russian leader regarding the use of chemical or tactical nuclear weapons.\n“Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II,” Biden said, adding that the US response to such actions would be “consequential.”\nPutin endorsed a new “deterrent” strategy in June 2020 that allowed for the use of nuclear weapons in response to a non-nuclear attack on Russia that threatened its existence.\nOn Tuesday, Russia’s lower house of parliament, the State Duma, amended the law on military service, toughening the punishment for violation of military service duties – such as desertion and evasion from service – according to state news agency TASS.\nThe bill sets a jail term of up to 15 years for resistance related to military service or coercion to violate an official military order, involving violence or the threat of its use, during the period of mobilization or martial law.\nJosh Pennington, Uliana Pavlova and CNN’s Jennifer Hansler, Anna Chernova and Tim Lister contributed to this report.\n', 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/europe/ukraine-russian-referendums-intl-hnk/index.html', 'CNN/2022/9/Russia_announces_immediate_partial_mobilization_of_citizens_escalating_its_invasion_of_Ukraine.png'),

He has recounted in recent speeches sitting around a table at last year’s Group of 7 summit in Cornwall, England, telling fellow leaders that “America is back.”\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, Biden has told audiences, asked him: “For how long?”\nThat question still hangs over Biden’s efforts on the world stage, even a year-and-a-half into his term, as his predecessor continues to wield influence over the Republican Party and prepares to mount another run for the White House. Biden himself said in an interview that aired Sunday that while he intends to run for reelection, a final decision “remains to be seen.”\nOne of the issues currently at the forefront of global affairs – the pained negotiations to restart the Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew – only underscores the effects of pendulum swings in American leadership.\nFor Biden, the yearly UN speech is another stab at explaining to the world how he has steered the United States back into a position of leadership after the “America First” years of Donald Trump.\nIn it, he will offer a “firm rebuke of Russia’s unjust war in Ukraine,” according to Sullivan, and deliver “a call to the world to continue to stand against the naked aggression that we’ve seen these past several months.”\nHe also plans to unveil “significant new announcements” toward combating food insecurity and “lay out in detail how the US has restored its global leadership and the integrity of its word on the world stage,” Sullivan said.\nAfter his speech Wednesday morning, Biden will host a pledging session for the Global Fund to Fight HIV, AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In the evening, Biden and the first lady will host a leaders’ reception at the American Museum of Natural History.\nThis week’s schedule was thrown into flux as world leaders assembled in London for Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral, one of the largest gatherings of heads-of-state in recent memory. Many flew from the British capital to New York for the UN meetings.\nInstead of his usual Tuesday morning speaking slot, Biden’s address was pushed back a day. Unlike the past several years, when the UN General Assembly was scaled down due to Covid-19, this year’s gathering is back to its usual in-person capacity.\nBiden and his aides have been drafting the address for several weeks, a period that coincided with Ukraine’s successful counteroffensive taking back some Russian-held territory after months of occupation. The initiative had been coordinated with American officials, including through enhanced information and intelligence sharing, and sustained by weaponry provided by the US and its allies.\nUS officials have cautioned Ukraine’s current gains don’t necessarily signal a wider change in the outlook of the war, which remains likely to be a prolonged conflict. A day ahead of Biden’s speech, two Russian-controlled regions in eastern Ukraine announced plans for referendums on officially joining Russia, votes the US has previously warned would be “shams.”\nOne of Biden’s objectives in his speech Wednesday will be to stress the importance of maintaining unity among western allies in supporting Ukraine in the uncertain months ahead.\nThat effort is made more difficult by a looming energy crisis as Russia withholds supplies of natural gas to Europe as winter sets in. Higher costs spurred in part by withering western sanctions on Moscow have led to an economic calamity that is causing political turmoil for many leaders in Biden’s coalition, including himself.\nThe President meets with one of those leaders, British Prime Minister Liz Truss, later Wednesday. It will be their first formal in-person talks since Truss entered office earlier this month following the decision of her predecessor, Boris Johnson, to step down.\nShe inherited a deep economic crisis, fueled by high inflation and soaring energy costs, that has led to fears the UK could soon enter a prolonged recession. While few in the Biden administration shed tears at Johnson’s resignation – Biden once described him as the “physical and emotional clone” of Trump – the US and the UK were deeply aligned in their approach to Russia under his leadership.\nWhite House officials expect that cooperation will continue under Truss, even as she comes under pressure to ease economic pressures at home.\nLess certain, however, is whether Truss’s hardline approach to Brexit will sour relations with Biden. The President has taken a personal interest in the particular issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a post-Brexit arrangement that requires extra checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\nThe rules were designed to keep the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland open and avoid a return to sectarian violence. But Truss has moved to rewrite those rules, causing deep anxiety in both Brussels and Washington.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is not expected in-person at this year’s general assembly, though his foreign minister Sergey Lavrov will be in New York for the event. Chinese President Xi Jinping is also not planning to attend the UN in person this year.\nThe two autocratic leaders, who met in-person last week, have deepened ties between their countries as relations with the west deteriorate. Biden has warned Xi against supporting Putin in his invasion of Ukraine, a theme he’s expected to reiterate in Wednesday’s speech.\nPutin and Xi’s absence underscores the limits of venues like the UN to resolve the world’s most serious problems. With permanent seats on the UN Security Council, Russia has resisted approving resolutions on Syria and Ukraine, leading to inaction.\nEfforts to reform the Security Council have gained more steam under the Biden administration, though prospects of breaking the body’s stalemate seem slim. Biden’s aides are still weighing how specifically he will speak to the US desire to reform the Security Council during his visit to the UN this week, but he is expected to make his views known at least in private with other leaders.\n“We’re committed to finding a way forward to make the UN fit for purpose for this century. And, currently, there is an attack on the UN system. There’s an attack on the charter. And that’s by a permanent member of the Security Council,” Biden’s ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n“I can’t change the fact that Russia is a permanent member of the Security Council, but I can continue the efforts that we have succeeded at, and that’s isolating them, condemning them, and making sure that they know and understand it’s not business as usual,” she told Jake Tapper.\n', 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/politics/joe-biden-united-nations-general-assembly/index.html', 'CNN/2022/9/Biden_arrives_at_the_UN_with_the_wind_at_his_back_but_worries_remain_as_Russias_war_in_Ukraine_drags_on.png'),

Prices fell every day since then and Thursday would have marked the 100th straight day of declines.\nThe plunge in gas prices was driven by a series of factors, including stronger supply and weaker demand as drivers balked at high prices and unprecedented releases of emergency oil by the White House.\nAt the same time, Russia’s oil flows have held up better than feared despite sanctions and the war in Ukraine.\nCheaper gas has been a major boost to the US economy, easing inflationary pressure and giving Americans extra cash to spend.\nA one-cent rise in gas prices is not a meaningful change for most drivers, and prices could slump again as global economic concerns grow along with fears that demand for fuel will keep sinking.\nYet if gas prices begin to rise that could undermine the Biden administration and the Fed’s efforts to keep inflation in check. Falling gas prices are the sole reason America’s consumer prices have remained steady overall during the past few months after rising sharply in 2021 and the beginning part of this year.\n', 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/energy/gas-prices-rise/index.html', 'CNN/2022/9/Americas_gas_prices_rise_for_the_first_time_in_99_days.png'),
(44, 6, '2022-09-21 05:29:00', 'Why people keep correcting the President', 'President Joe Biden vowed to voters he would always give it to them straight. But his blunt talk keeps getting him into trouble.\nBiden is on a streak of talking “straight from the shoulder,” as he once said, on Taiwan, the pandemic, ex-President Donald Trump’s extreme MAGA supporters and whether Vladimir Putin should be leading Russia.\nBut each time he lays down the law, some White House official, Democratic lawmaker or political ally explains that the President didn’t actually say what everyone heard him say, or that he didn’t actually mean what he appeared to.\nNow, all the mopping up is raising the question of whether the walk-backs are doing more damage than the President’s initial frankness by undermining his authority.\nBiden is a self-admitted gaffe machine – his loose tongue often got him into hot water in the Senate and was why he was initially mistrusted by some Obama administration aides as vice president. But Biden is now the commander in chief and can say what he wants – until the clean-up operation kicks into action.\nWhite House says Covid-19 policy unchanged despite Biden\'s comments that the \'pandemic is over\'\nOften, this comes across as disrespectful to the President. It makes it look like he doesn’t know his own mind, or has strayed from a script that subordinates set for him. It offers an opening for Republicans who cast doubt on his cognitive capacity and his fitness for prime time. But the problem also runs deeper: A president’s words resonate. In times of crisis, lives can be on the line. Their words move markets. Being constantly corrected sows confusion about Biden’s authority and leadership.\nPoliticians often run for office promising to tell it is as it is. Biden’s friend, the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, for instance, rode his way to the 2008 Republican nomination aboard a “Straight Talk Express.” But honesty and bluntness often are not conducive to governing. When the big guy strays off message, he can short-circuit policy machinery and can undermine nuanced positions on Capitol Hill. This was the case this week, when Biden’s declaration that the pandemic was over in a “60 Minutes” interview undermined a push by House and Senate Democrats for the White House’s own request for billions of dollars more in Covid-19 funding.\nBiden on Taiwan: strategic confusion or a stroke of genius?\nBiden set off an international controversy over his latest pledge, in the interview broadcast on Sunday, to defend Taiwan if China invaded. He’s said something similar at least three previous times, trampling all over the principle of “strategic ambiguity” that leaves opaque how the US would respond. The policy is designed to make China think twice but also to avoid giving the Taiwanese a sense of security that could spur an independence declaration.\nBut each time Biden has apparently moved the ball on Taiwan, his officials put it back.\nWhite House says Biden was answering a hypothetical, not announcing a policy change on Taiwan\nThere is little doubt that Biden knew exactly what he was doing when he replied “yes” to a precise question from CBS’ Scott Pelley on “60 Minutes” about whether he would deploy US men and women to defend Taiwan if it was invaded.\nBut national security adviser Jake Sullivan insisted on Tuesday that Biden hadn’t changed policy and dismissed it as an answer to a “hypothetical” question, even though US intelligence thinks China is building a force capable of taking Taiwan.\n“The President is a direct and straightforward person. He answered a hypothetical. He’s answered it before in a similar way.  And he has also been clear that he has not changed US policy towards Taiwan,” Sullivan told reporters.\nBiden did indeed reaffirm his support in the interview for the “One China” policy and other foundational diplomatic texts with China. But Sullivan’s comment suggests there is a gap between what US policy is toward Taiwan and what Biden says it is. That will raise fears of misunderstandings that could be dangerous.\nBiden’s allies on Capitol Hill argued Tuesday that strategic confusion can be a virtue — after all, if Americans can’t work out what the policy is then China has no chance.\n“Even a walk back, it becomes strategic ambiguity, so I think it’s all part of strategic ambiguity,” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said Tuesday. His Democratic colleague from Connecticut, Sen. Chris Murphy, also made the case that this is less a disconnect inside the White House than an example of strategic shrewdness.\n“Whether it’s intentional or not, it certainly serves the purpose of keeping China guessing. And that’s the whole point, is to be in a position to defend Taiwan without making the explicit promise ahead of time,” Murphy said.\nBut Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that the uncertainty was damaging.\n“You know, what are they going to think is our policy if they have the President of the United States saying we will go to war and that’s not consistent with what anyone else is saying?”\n“So it’s not a good thing for China to have to look at.”\nFormer Trump administration Defense Secretary Mark Esper, however, sought to co-opt the President into the camp of hawks who want a tougher Taiwan policy.\n“He’s said it four times now, I think he’s spot on and they are not trying to downplay it, they are trying to completely undermine him to say there’s no policy change,” Esper told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “We need to move away from strategic ambiguity if we are going to deter a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.”\nTough talk on Putin\nIt’s not the first time the President’s plain talk has reverberated abroad.\nIn Warsaw in March, he said that Putin “cannot remain in power.” The White House rushed to explain the President wasn’t talking about regime change. And foreign policy experts faulted him for personalizing the feud with Putin over Ukraine. But Biden’s comment has aged well, at least as a moral judgment. And the President has actually assiduously avoided testing Putin’s invisible red lines that could trigger a clash with NATO.\nIn fact, his swipe at Putin pales in comparison to the intemperance of his some of his predecessors, including former President Donald Trump, who boasted about having a “much bigger” and “more powerful” nuclear button than North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. And in 1984, a leaked joke made during a microphone test by President Ronald Reagan about the US beginning the bombing of Russia “in five minutes” caused uproar.\nBiden offers GOP opening after declaring the pandemic over\nBut Biden’s straight talk isn’t just causing problems abroad. His remark in the “60 Minutes” interview that the “pandemic is over” set government public health officials scrambling, seemed to annoy Democrats on Capitol Hill who have argued for more aid and offered Republicans an opening. Biden did condition his remark by saying that Covid-19 still a problem and there is a lot of work to do. But he again caused officials to try and reframe exactly what he meant and stirred criticism from epidemiologists.\nBiden declares the pandemic over. People are acting like it too\n“What the President is reflecting is the fact that we’ve made tremendous progress against Covid-19. We’re in a very different place now than we were at the beginning of this pandemic,” Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told MSNBC in attempt to defuse Biden’s remark without contradicting him.\nThe impression that Biden’s remark was a rash aside rather than a considered strategy was bolstered on Tuesday night when Biden adopted Murthy’s framing at a fundraiser in New York.\nSome medical experts warned that the President had discounted coronavirus deaths roughly equivalent to the toll of September, 11, 2001 every week. They said their metrics didn’t justify declaring the pandemic over. And they worried Biden had harmed efforts to encourage people to get boosted.\nYet Biden might also be right. For many Americans, the sick and vulnerable aside, the pandemic – as it was originally experienced in the depths of 2020 – has ended. The disease is now becoming endemic and thanks to vaccines, life is returning to normal for many people. Sports stadiums are crowded with maskless fans. Nations like New Zealand and Australia, which cut themselves off from the world, have relaxed travel restrictions. Only China is sticking with its “zero-Covid” policy — apparently to spare the embarrassment of the hardline leaders that mandated it.\nStill, Biden did create a huge political headache since the administration is asking Congress for another $22.4 billion for Covid mitigation efforts.\n“We need some more sources to be sure that it’s over,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday.\n“Covid is not over,” Kaine, the Virginia Democrat said, adding, “We need aid.”\nGOP leaders say approving Covid aid will be even harder after Biden \'pandemic is over\' remark\nBut Republicans like Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who is a member of his party’s leadership, seized the moment: “If it’s over, then I wouldn’t suspect they need any more money.”\nBiden’s habit of making bold statements that get clarified may also haunt him on the campaign trail. Last month, in an off-the-cuff comment, he described Trump’s “extreme MAGA philosophy” as “semi-fascism.”\nEven some Democrats thought he went too far, and Biden seems to agree he blundered into a Hillary Clinton-style “basket of deplorables” gaffe. He hasn’t used the construction since and insists that only extreme MAGA voters, not all Republicans, are bad.\nBut everyone now knows what he really thinks. The same may be true of Taiwan, although Sullivan insisted at the White House that what Biden said doesn’t count.\n“When the President of the United States wants to announce a policy change, he will do so. He has not done so,” the national security adviser said.\nBut after so many unequivocal statements and walk backs, how will anybody know for sure if he does?\n', 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/politics/biden-comments-covid-taiwan-walkbacks-analysis/index.html', 'CNN/2022/9/Why_people_keep_correcting_the_President.png'),

The mobilization would mean citizens who are in the reserve and those with military experience would be subject to conscription, he added.\nPutin framed the fighting as part of a larger struggle for Russian survival against a West whose goal is it is to “weaken, divide and ultimately destroy our country.”\nIt is unclear what impact Putin’s comments will have on India’s position on the war.\nSince the start of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, India has sought to carve a middle path between Moscow and its Western critics, largely steering clear of condemning a country that remains its biggest arms supplier and with which it has ties dating back to the Cold War.\nIt has so far largely resisted Western pressure to cut its economic ties with the Kremlin, instead increasing its purchases of Russian oil, coal and fertilizer, and has repeatedly abstained from a United Nations vote on suspending Russia from the Human Rights Council, instead calling for “dialogue and diplomacy.”\nHowever, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi appeared to indicate a potential change in tone last week, telling Russian President Vladimir Putin that now is not the time for war.\nThe comments from Modi came during a face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of the the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Uzbekistan.\n“I know that today’s era is not of war and we have talked to you many times over the phone on the subject that democracy and diplomacy and dialogue are all these things that touch the world,” Modi told Putin.\nWhile India’s relationship with Russia goes back decades, New Delhi’s ties with the West have been growing ever closer since Modi’s election in 2014.

Both China and India maintain strong ties with Russia and had sought to remain neutral on Ukraine.\nXi, in a statement released by his government, expressed support for Russia\'s \"core interests\" but also interest in working together to \"inject stability\" into world affairs. Modi said he wanted to discuss \"how we can move forward on the path of peace,\" adding that the biggest concerns facing the world are the problems of food security, fuel security and fertilizers.\n\"We must find some way out and you too must contribute to that,\" Modi stressed in a rare public rebuke.\nThe comments cast a shadow over a summit that Putin had hoped would burnish his diplomatic status and show he was not so internationally isolated.\nOn the battlefield, Britain\'s defence ministry said the new front line likely is between the Oskil River and Svatove, some 150 kilometres southeast of Kharkiv, Ukraine\'s second-largest city.\nThe new line emerged after the Ukrainian counteroffensive punched a hole through the war\'s previous front line, allowing Kyiv\'s soldiers to recapture large swaths of land in the northeastern Kharkiv region that borders Russia.\nAfter the Russian troops retreated from the city of Izium, Ukrainian authorities discovered a mass grave site, one of the largest found so far.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that more than 440 graves at the location containing the bodies of hundreds of civilian adults and children, as well as soldiers, and that some had been tortured, shot or killed by artillery shelling. He cited evidence of atrocities, such as a body with a rope around its neck and broken arms.\n\"Torture was a widespread practice in the occupied territory. That\'s what the Nazis did. That\'s what [the Russians] do,\" Zelenskyy said Saturday in his nightly video address. \"We will establish the identity of all those who tortured, who mocked, who brought this atrocity from Russia here to Ukrainian soil.\"\nUkrainian forces, in the meantime, were crossing the Oskil River in the Kharkiv region and have placed artillery there, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said Saturday.\nThe river, which flows south from Russia into Ukraine, had been a natural break in the newly emerged front lines since Ukraine launched its push about a week ago.\n\"Russian forces are likely too weak to prevent further Ukrainian advances along the entire Oskil River,\" the institute said.\nSigns of advancement in east\nVideos circulating online indicated that Ukrainian forces were continuing to retake land in the country\'s embattled east, although their veracity could not be independently verified.\nOne video showed a Ukrainian soldier walking past a damaged building, then pointing up over his shoulder at a colleague hanging the blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag over a mobile phone tower. The soldier in the video identified the seized village as Dibrova, just northeast of the city of Sloviansk in Ukraine\'s Donetsk region.\nAnother video showed two Ukrainian soldiers in what appeared to be a bell tower, with one saying they had retaken the village of Shchurove, also northeast of Sloviansk.\nThe Ukrainian military and the Russians did not comment on the two villages.\nElsewhere, Russian forces continued pounding cities and villages with missile strikes and shelling.\nA Russian missile attack early Saturday started a fire in Kharkiv\'s industrial area, said Oleh Syniehubov, the regional governor. Firefighters extinguished the blaze.\nSyniehubov said remnants of the missiles suggest the Russians fired S-300 surface-to-air missiles at the city. The S-300 is designed for striking missiles or aircraft in the sky, not targets on the ground. Analysts say Russia\'s use of the missiles suggest they may be running out of some precision munitions.\nShelling of the nearby city of Chuhuiv later on Saturday killed an 11-year-old girl, Syniehubov reported.\nIn the southern Zaporizhzhia region, a large part of which is occupied by Russian forces, one person was wounded in shelling of the city of Orikhiv, Zaporizhzhia\'s Ukrainian governor Oleksandr Starukh reported on Telegram. He said Russian troops also shelled two villages in the region, destroying several civilian facilities.\nExplosions were also reported in Russian-occupied parts of Zaporizhzhia. Russian-installed official Vladimir Rogov said on Telegram that at least five blasts were heard in the city of Melitopol. The city\'s Ukrainian mayor, Ivan Fedorov, said they were in a village south of the city, where the Russian troops had relocated some military equipment.\nUkraine\'s central Dnipropetrovsk region also came under Russian fire overnight, according to its governor, Valentyn Reznichenko. \"The enemy attacked six times and launched more than 90 deadly projectiles on peaceful cities and villages,\" Reznichenko said.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine\'s atomic energy operator, Energoatom, said a convoy of 25 trucks has brought diesel fuel and other critical supplies to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — Europe\'s largest, which was shut down a week ago amid fears that fighting in the area could result in a radiation disaster.\nThe trucks were allowed through Russian checkpoints on Friday to deliver spare parts for repairs of damaged power lines, chemicals for the operation of the plant and additional fuel for backup diesel generators, Energoatom said.\n', 'https://cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-russia-war-northeast-pressure-1.6586737', 'CBC/2022/9/Ukraines_push_against_Russian_troops_in_northeast_puts_pressure_on_Putins_war__CBC_News.png'),

Putin also warned the West that \"it\'s not a bluff\" that Russia would use all the means at its disposal to protect its territory.\nThe total number of reservists drafted in the partial mobilization is 300,000, officials said.\nThe Russian leader\'s televised address to the nation comes a day after Russian-controlled regions in eastern and southern Ukraine announced plans to hold votes on becoming integral parts of Russia. The Kremlin-backed efforts to swallow up four regions could set the stage for Moscow to escalate the war following Ukrainian successes.\nThe referendums, which have been expected to take place since the first months of the war that began on Feb. 24, will start Friday in the Luhansk, Kherson and partly Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions.\nPutin accused the West in engaging in \"nuclear blackmail\" and noted \"statements of some high-ranking representatives of the leading NATO states about the possibility of using nuclear weapons of mass destruction against Russia.\"\n\"To those who allow themselves such statements regarding Russia, I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction, and for separate components and more modern than those of NATO countries and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal,\" Putin said.\nHe added: \"It\'s not a bluff.\"\nPutin said he has signed a decree on the partial mobilization, which is due to start on Wednesday.\n\"We are talking about partial mobilization, that is, only citizens who are currently in the reserve will be subject to conscription, and above all, those who served in the armed forces have a certain military specialty and relevant experience,\" Putin said.\nRussian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said in a televised interview Wednesday that conscripts and students won\'t be mobilized — only those with relevant combat and service experience will be.\nHe said that 5,937 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine so far. Western estimates of Russian military losses stand at tens of thousands.\nShoigu\'s update on Russian losses is the third time the Russian military offered death toll numbers to the public. The last update came in late March, when the Defence Ministry claimed 1,351 Russian soldiers were killed in Ukraine.\nPutin said the decision to partially mobilize was \"fully adequate to the threats we face, namely to protect our homeland, its sovereignty and territorial integrity, to ensure the security of our people and people in the liberated territories.\"\nEarlier Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed Russian plans to stage referendums in occupied regions in eastern and southern Ukraine as a \"noise\" and thanked Ukraine\'s allies for condemning the votes scheduled to start Friday.\nFormer Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia\'s Security Council chaired by Putin, said referendums that fold regions into Russia itself would make redrawn frontiers \"irreversible\" and enable Moscow to use \"any means\" to defend them.\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy said there were lots of questions surrounding the announcements but stressed that they would not change Ukraine\'s commitment to retake areas occupied by Russian forces.\n\"The situation on the front line clearly indicates that the initiative belongs to Ukraine,\" he said. \"Our positions do not change because of the noise or any announcements somewhere. And we enjoy the full support of our partners in this.\"\nZelenskyy calls referendums a \'sham\'\nThe upcoming votes, in the Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions are all but certain to go Moscow\'s way. But they were quickly dismissed as illegitimate by Western leaders who are backing Kyiv with military and other support that has helped its forces seize momentum on battlefields in the east and south.\n\"I thank all friends and partners of Ukraine for today\'s mass principled firm condemnation of Russia\'s attempts to stage new sham referenda,\" Zelenskyy said.\nIn another signal that Russia is digging in for a protracted and possibly ramped-up conflict, the Kremlin-controlled lower of house of parliament voted Tuesday to toughen laws against desertion, surrender and looting by Russian troops. Lawmakers also voted to introduce possible 10-year prison terms for soldiers refusing to fight.\nIf approved, as expected, by the upper house and then signed by Putin, the legislation would strengthen commanders\' hands against failing morale reported among soldiers.\nIn the Russian-occupied city of Enerhodar, shelling continued around Europe\'s largest nuclear power plant. Ukrainian energy operator Energoatom said Russian shelling again damaged infrastructure at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and briefly forced workers to start two diesel generators for emergency power to the cooling pumps for one of the reactors.\nSuch pumps are essential for avoiding a meltdown at a nuclear facility even though all six of the plant\'s reactors have been shut down. Energoatom said the generators were later switched off as main power was restored.\nThe Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has been a focus for concern for months because of fears that shelling could lead to a radiation leak.

Modi said he wanted to discuss \"how we can move forward on the path of peace,\" adding that the biggest concerns facing the world are the problems of food security, fuel security and fertilizers.\n\"We must find some way out and you too must contribute to that,\" Modi stressed in a rare public rebuke.\nThe comments cast a shadow over a summit that Putin had hoped would burnish his diplomatic status and show he was not so internationally isolated.\nOn the battlefield, Britain\'s defence ministry said the new front line likely is between the Oskil River and Svatove, some 150 kilometres southeast of Kharkiv, Ukraine\'s second-largest city.\nThe new line emerged after the Ukrainian counteroffensive punched a hole through the war\'s previous front line, allowing Kyiv\'s soldiers to recapture large swaths of land in the northeastern Kharkiv region that borders Russia.\nAfter the Russian troops retreated from the city of Izium, Ukrainian authorities discovered a mass grave site, one of the largest found so far.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that more than 440 graves at the location containing the bodies of hundreds of civilian adults and children, as well as soldiers, and that some had been tortured, shot or killed by artillery shelling. He cited evidence of atrocities, such as a body with a rope around its neck and broken arms.\n\"Torture was a widespread practice in the occupied territory. That\'s what the Nazis did. That\'s what [the Russians] do,\" Zelenskyy said Saturday in his nightly video address. \"We will establish the identity of all those who tortured, who mocked, who brought this atrocity from Russia here to Ukrainian soil.\"\nUkrainian forces, in the meantime, were crossing the Oskil River in the Kharkiv region and have placed artillery there, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said Saturday.\nThe river, which flows south from Russia into Ukraine, had been a natural break in the newly emerged front lines since Ukraine launched its push about a week ago.\n\"Russian forces are likely too weak to prevent further Ukrainian advances along the entire Oskil River,\" the institute said.\nSigns of advancement in east\nVideos circulating online indicated that Ukrainian forces were continuing to retake land in the country\'s embattled east, although their veracity could not be independently verified.\nOne video showed a Ukrainian soldier walking past a damaged building, then pointing up over his shoulder at a colleague hanging the blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag over a mobile phone tower. The soldier in the video identified the seized village as Dibrova, just northeast of the city of Sloviansk in Ukraine\'s Donetsk region.\nAnother video showed two Ukrainian soldiers in what appeared to be a bell tower, with one saying they had retaken the village of Shchurove, also northeast of Sloviansk.\nThe Ukrainian military and the Russians did not comment on the two villages.\nElsewhere, Russian forces continued pounding cities and villages with missile strikes and shelling.\nA Russian missile attack early Saturday started a fire in Kharkiv\'s industrial area, said Oleh Syniehubov, the regional governor. Firefighters extinguished the blaze.\nSyniehubov said remnants of the missiles suggest the Russians fired S-300 surface-to-air missiles at the city. The S-300 is designed for striking missiles or aircraft in the sky, not targets on the ground. Analysts say Russia\'s use of the missiles suggest they may be running out of some precision munitions.\nShelling of the nearby city of Chuhuiv later on Saturday killed an 11-year-old girl, Syniehubov reported.\nIn the southern Zaporizhzhia region, a large part of which is occupied by Russian forces, one person was wounded in shelling of the city of Orikhiv, Zaporizhzhia\'s Ukrainian governor Oleksandr Starukh reported on Telegram. He said Russian troops also shelled two villages in the region, destroying several civilian facilities.\nExplosions were also reported in Russian-occupied parts of Zaporizhzhia. Russian-installed official Vladimir Rogov said on Telegram that at least five blasts were heard in the city of Melitopol. The city\'s Ukrainian mayor, Ivan Fedorov, said they were in a village south of the city, where the Russian troops had relocated some military equipment.\nUkraine\'s central Dnipropetrovsk region also came under Russian fire overnight, according to its governor, Valentyn Reznichenko. \"The enemy attacked six times and launched more than 90 deadly projectiles on peaceful cities and villages,\" Reznichenko said.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine\'s atomic energy operator, Energoatom, said a convoy of 25 trucks has brought diesel fuel and other critical supplies to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — Europe\'s largest, which was shut down a week ago amid fears that fighting in the area could result in a radiation disaster.\nThe trucks were allowed through Russian checkpoints on Friday to deliver spare parts for repairs of damaged power lines, chemicals for the operation of the plant and additional fuel for backup diesel generators, Energoatom said.\n', 'https://cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-russia-war-northeast-pressure-1.6586737', 'CBC/2022/9/Ukraines_push_against_Russian_troops_in_northeast_puts_pressure_on_Putins_war__CBC_News.png'),

Putin also warned the West that \"it\'s not a bluff\" that Russia would use all the means at its disposal to protect its territory.\nThe total number of reservists drafted in the partial mobilization is 300,000, officials said.\nThe Russian leader\'s televised address to the nation comes a day after Russian-controlled regions in eastern and southern Ukraine announced plans to hold votes on becoming integral parts of Russia. The Kremlin-backed efforts to swallow up four regions could set the stage for Moscow to escalate the war following Ukrainian successes.\nThe referendums, which have been expected to take place since the first months of the war that began on Feb. 24, will start Friday in the Luhansk, Kherson and partly Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions.\nPutin accused the West in engaging in \"nuclear blackmail\" and noted \"statements of some high-ranking representatives of the leading NATO states about the possibility of using nuclear weapons of mass destruction against Russia.\"\n\"To those who allow themselves such statements regarding Russia, I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction, and for separate components and more modern than those of NATO countries and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal,\" Putin said.\nHe added: \"It\'s not a bluff.\"\nPutin said he has signed a decree on the partial mobilization, which is due to start on Wednesday.\n\"We are talking about partial mobilization, that is, only citizens who are currently in the reserve will be subject to conscription, and above all, those who served in the armed forces have a certain military specialty and relevant experience,\" Putin said.\nRussian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said in a televised interview Wednesday that conscripts and students won\'t be mobilized — only those with relevant combat and service experience will be.\nHe said that 5,937 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine so far. Western estimates of Russian military losses stand at tens of thousands.\nShoigu\'s update on Russian losses is the third time the Russian military offered death toll numbers to the public. The last update came in late March, when the Defence Ministry claimed 1,351 Russian soldiers were killed in Ukraine.\nPutin said the decision to partially mobilize was \"fully adequate to the threats we face, namely to protect our homeland, its sovereignty and territorial integrity, to ensure the security of our people and people in the liberated territories.\"\nEarlier Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed Russian plans to stage referendums in occupied regions in eastern and southern Ukraine as a \"noise\" and thanked Ukraine\'s allies for condemning the votes scheduled to start Friday.\nFormer Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia\'s Security Council chaired by Putin, said referendums that fold regions into Russia itself would make redrawn frontiers \"irreversible\" and enable Moscow to use \"any means\" to defend them.\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy said there were lots of questions surrounding the announcements but stressed that they would not change Ukraine\'s commitment to retake areas occupied by Russian forces.\n\"The situation on the front line clearly indicates that the initiative belongs to Ukraine,\" he said. \"Our positions do not change because of the noise or any announcements somewhere. And we enjoy the full support of our partners in this.\"\nZelenskyy calls referendums a \'sham\'\nThe upcoming votes, in the Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions are all but certain to go Moscow\'s way. But they were quickly dismissed as illegitimate by Western leaders who are backing Kyiv with military and other support that has helped its forces seize momentum on battlefields in the east and south.\n\"I thank all friends and partners of Ukraine for today\'s mass principled firm condemnation of Russia\'s attempts to stage new sham referenda,\" Zelenskyy said.\nIn another signal that Russia is digging in for a protracted and possibly ramped-up conflict, the Kremlin-controlled lower of house of parliament voted Tuesday to toughen laws against desertion, surrender and looting by Russian troops. Lawmakers also voted to introduce possible 10-year prison terms for soldiers refusing to fight.\nIf approved, as expected, by the upper house and then signed by Putin, the legislation would strengthen commanders\' hands against failing morale reported among soldiers.\nIn the Russian-occupied city of Enerhodar, shelling continued around Europe\'s largest nuclear power plant. Ukrainian energy operator Energoatom said Russian shelling again damaged infrastructure at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and briefly forced workers to start two diesel generators for emergency power to the cooling pumps for one of the reactors.\nSuch pumps are essential for avoiding a meltdown at a nuclear facility even though all six of the plant\'s reactors have been shut down. Energoatom said the generators were later switched off as main power was restored.\nThe Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has been a focus for concern for months because of fears that shelling could lead to a radiation leak.

But some analysts say the move will have only a limited impact on the front lines of the conflict.\nIn a televised address on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “partial mobilisation” of Russia\'s reservist forces to help boost the war effort in Ukraine.\nThe mobilisation of these forces will serve to “protect our nation, its sovereignty and territorial integrity\" as well as \"ensure the security of our people and those in areas that have been liberated”, he said, the latter a reference to occupied areas of Ukraine.\nIn his speech, Putin appeared to shift from his previous justification for the invasion – that Russia was merely conducting a “special military operation” in Ukraine – to invoking a more existential threat, namely that Russia is resisting an onslaught from a West whose objective is \"to weaken, divide and finally destroy this country\".\nShortly after Putin\'s speech his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Russia is not at war with Ukraine but with the \"collective West”. Shoigu also offered more details on the new plan, specifying that it would involve only 300,000 reservists who have already served in combat.\nBut some fear this is just the beginning of a broader mobilisation. “The mobilisation order is formulated in the vaguest terms possible, allowing the minister of defence to decide who and how many people will be sent to the front. Sergei Shoigu has capped the number at 300,000, but he can revise this at any moment and mobilise unlimited reservists,” Pavel Chikov, a Russian lawyer and chairman of the Agora International Human Rights Group, wrote on Telegram.\n>> ‘Ghost recruits’: Is Putin raising a Potemkin army to boost troop numbers?\nThe number of Russian reservists that could eventually be called up remains unknown, with estimates varying widely.\n“In theory, Russia can mobilise between 2 and 20 million men,” said Nicolo Fasola, a specialist in the Russian military at the University of Bologna. Two million men who have served in the last five years could be considered among those who have seen combat and are thus eligible for mobilisation. In all, Fasola said, 20 million men on the list of reservists are still of an age to serve at the front.\nShoigu said around 25 million people meet the criteria to be mobilised, but that only around 1 percent will be called up.\nFor now, Fasola said, the discussion of mobilising just 300,000 troops allows the government to maintain the illusion among the Russian population that the invasion remains a “special military operation” that does not yet require total nationwide mobilisation, allowing Putin to stick with his “propaganda message”.\n\'More prisoners and more dead\'\nPutin\'s latest move has a public relations goal as well as a strategic one, said Jeff Hawn, an expert on Russian military affairs. “The main target of Putin\'s allocution is the West – he wants to show he can up the ante. But by sticking to a \'partial\' mobilisation, he also tries to mitigate internal backlash,” said Hawn, a consultant for the New Lines Institute think tank. Moreover, Putin want to show the world that he commands an army with enough reservists to continue fighting.\nOver the past several weeks, the Ukrainian army has routed Russian forces from the Kharkiv region of northeast Ukraine and has forced them to retreat even from areas of Luhansk in the Donbas.\nMobilising more troops is key if Russia wants to resist the Ukrainian advance, Fasola said. \"The addition of 300,000 men is a necessary step. Otherwise the prospect of losing the war was becoming very real.\"\nBut the impact of this mobilisation may be limited, said Hawn, noting that it is really “just making official the unofficial shadow mobilisation” that has been going on for months.\n\"The largest impact that this partial mobilisation will have is more prisoners and more dead, because this military doctrine doesn\'t address the fundamental problem of the Russian army,\" Hawn said.\nThese reservists “will receive only short training sessions and won\'t have any prior experience in fighting alongside the men already on the front. And [they] don\'t know the commanding officers,” Hawn noted, adding that this will only undermine the cohesion of Russia\'s fighting force.\nBut there is one notable difference with this latest decree: Reservists refusing to head to the front will now face lengthy prison terms of between 10 and 15 years.\nIndeed, Putin\'s call for Russians to defend the country from the onslaught from the West may be having little effect in whipping up patriotic fervor. Protests against the mobilisation announcement erupted across Russia on Wednesday, with more than 1,200 people detained, according to local independent monitoring group OVD-Info.\nMany Russians were observed trying to leave the country as soon as the tougher penalties for those who refuse to take up arms were announced. As Turkish journalist Ragıp Soylu said on Twitter, \"direct flights between Moscow and Istanbul or Yerevan are fully booked\".\nReservists without weapons?\n\"Russia is sticking with a military doctrine of overwhelming the enemy with numbers,” Fasola said. \"Moscow saw it work in Georgia (in 2008) and in Ukraine in 2014 and thought it was still a valid option. But this time seems to be different.\"\nMoreover, sending more reservists does not address some of the Russian military\'s fundamental weaknesses. \"This doctrine does not make it possible to compensate for the shortcomings of the Russian army brought to light by this war,\" Hawn observed. Facing off against Ukrainians armed with modern Western weapons and officers influenced by NATO strategists, he said the Russians appear ill-equipped and poorly commanded.\nAbove all, Russia may be facing a problem supplying the necessary materiel. The Russian military sector has been affected by both the war and Western sanctions, Fasola said. Equipping 300,000 new troops will likely involve relying on outdated stockpiles of weapons that may prove ineffective against the technologies Ukraine is now using.\nPutin has already said he wants to increase the production of arms. But that takes time, Fasola said.\n“I would say that bringing the soldiers to the front might take a month or so,” he estimated. “Much less [time] than producing more weapons – which could lead to an awkward situation for the army, where the soldiers are available but not fully equipped.\"\n', 'https://france24.com/en/europe/20220921-partial-mobilisation-of-russian-reservists-may-reveal-putin-s-desperation', 'France24/2022/9/Partial_mobilisation_of_Russian_reservists_may_reveal_Putins_desperation.png'),

The army claims to have recaptured more than 400 localities since the beginning of September and pushed Russian forces back towards the border.\nWestern defense officials and analysts said on Saturday that they believed the Russian forces were setting up a new defensive line between the Oskil River and Svatoe, some 150 kilometres southeast of the regional capital Kharkiv, as a counter-measure. Moscow “likely sees maintaining control of this zone as important because it is transited by one of the few main resupply routes Russia still controls from the Belgorod region of Russia”, the British defense ministry told AP.\nIn Kharkiv, the advance of Ukrainian forces is being met with both hope and apprehension.

Her life has been put on hold ever since Vladimir Putin launched his \"special military operation\".\nRussian forces kept in check\nInitiated on 24 February, the Russian offensive caught the Ukrainian forces off guard. Neither military experts nor the Ukrainian government had seriously considered the possibility that an offensive might extend beyond the Donbas region.\nWithin 24 hours, Russian troops reached the northern suburbs of Kharkiv. But the fighting stalled. Despite their greater numbers, the Russian forces did not manage to enter the city. In mid-May, the Russians, who had still not managed to surround Kharkiv, finally retreated.\nOleksiy Melnyk, a Ukrainian military expert and researcher at the Razumkov Centre in Ukraine, says this failure demonstrates that the Russians committed a major strategic error.\n\"It seems obvious that Russia has largely underestimated the degree of Ukrainian resistance. This is especially true in Kharkiv, which is a Russian-speaking city, close to the border and whose mayor was perceived as one of President Zelensky’s opponents. The Russian authorities see no distinction between the president and the state. They have not understood that just because Ukrainians speak Russian, watch Russian television and criticise their president, they will not automatically consider the invader as their saviour.\"\nPunitive strikes\nBlocked on the city’s outskirts, the Russian army unleashed a deluge of fire on Kharkiv. According to Andrii Kravchenko, the region\'s deputy prosecutor, as quoted in a Human Rights Watch report, at least 1,019 civilians have been killed and 1,947 wounded in hundreds of attacks since late February.\n\"Kharkiv is probably the city that has been hit hardest by the Russians,\" says Donatella Rivera, an Amnesty International researcher, whose report denounces the \"incessant\" and \"indiscriminate\" attacks on the city.\nAs the months go by, Ivana has learned to live with the sound of the constant blasts. \"These sounds have become familiar here, everyone can hear the difference between incoming and outgoing missiles, the types of weapons used and how far away they are. We have developed this new skill. In Kharkiv, because we are so close to Russia, the rockets sometimes take less than a minute to arrive, which is a big problem for the air defence system. We are hostages to geography,\" says the young woman.\nThere is no doubt in Melnyk’s mind that these intensive bombardments are \"punitive strikes\" that reflect the Russian government’s anger at its failure to take the city. \"Kharkiv is a megalopolis that is home to several strategic military installations, including a major tank factory. But these facilities are not priority targets for Russia, whose strikes are mostly aimed at civilian areas and administrative buildings. It is clear that the purpose of this bombing campaign is to terrorise the population rather than counter a potential threat,\" he concluded.\n‘Constant uncertainty’\nWhile nearly half of the city’s 1.4 million inhabitants have left, according to local authorities\' estimates, Ivana has decided to stay \"to support the war effort\". She now works odd jobs and volunteers with an NGO that collects military and medical supplies for the forces on the ground and civilian hospitals.\nSince the strike on the electricity grid, power has returned and a semblance of normal life has resumed. \"Last night there was only one strike. I almost forgot that we were at war,\" says the young woman, who does not hide her anxiety.\n\"The counter-offensive gives me hope. In Kharkiv, there is great solidarity, volunteers are playing a very important role, especially in helping civilians return to the liberated areas. But I am very worried, as winter is fast approaching. So far, I have managed to stay in my flat despite a lack of funds. But what will happen if the Russian strikes leave us without water or electricity? I\'m not sure I can stay. In this war, the hardest thing to live with is the constant uncertainty that eats away at us.\"\n', 'https://france24.com/en/europe/20220917-kharkiv-ukraine-s-second-largest-city-is-a-symbol-of-resistance', 'France24/2022/9/Kharkiv_Ukraines_second_largest_city_is_a_symbol_of_resistance.png'),

It also comes as Ukrainian forces consolidate gains against Russian forces in the east of the country in a dramatic offensive aided by Western weapons.\nVon der Leyen said Thursday\'s visit was her third to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February, but this one was different. \"We will never be able to match the sacrifice that the Ukrainians are making,\" she told reporters during a joint press conference with Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\"But what we can tell you is that you\'ll have your European friends by your side as long as it takes,\" she said. Upon her arrival she noted her discussions with Ukraine\'s leaders would be about \"getting our economies and people closer.\"\nUkraine gained EU candidacy status in June at the same time as ex-Soviet Moldova, which borders Ukraine and like its neighbour has had Russian troops stationed in an eastern breakaway region. Zelensky told the same press conference that his country wants to join the European single market ahead of a decision on whether to grant Kyiv full EU membership.\n\nZelensky promises \'victory\'\nThe historic candidacy vote angered Moscow, which has tried to retain political and military influence in both countries since the collapse of the Soviet Union three decades ago. EU countries have staunchly supported Ukraine since Moscow invaded in February by hitting Russia with economic penalties.\nMany members of the bloc have supplied Kyiv with advanced weapons that have helped Ukrainian forces in recent weeks recapture swathes of territory. Von der Leyen said just ahead of her trip that the successive waves of EU sanctions against Russia would remain and that Europeans must keep their resolve against Moscow.\n\"I want to make it very clear, the sanctions are here to stay,\" she told the European Parliament. The Kremlin maintains that Russia has weathered the economic penalties and Moscow has responded by reducing or halting entirely gas flows to European countries.\nWith winter fast approaching, this has forced the EU to source alternative supplies, agree plans to cut consumption and roll out financial support in the face of skyrocketing prices. Ukrainian energy facilities, including Europe\'s biggest atomic plant, have been hit by Russian strikes and Zelensky on Thursday thanked the EU leader for linking Kyiv to \"European power grids\".\n\"It\'s in everyone\'s interest: European countries can get cheap electricity from Ukraine\" and \"we\'ll be able to get money for salaries and social payments in such difficult times,\" he said.\nPutin praises Xi\'s stance\nUkraine\'s forces have also posted slower, but steady gains in the southern Kherson region near the Black Sea. The Ukrainian presidency said on Thursday that intense fighting was ongoing around that southern front, adding that the military situation \"remains extremely difficult.\"\nLocal officials in the region around Zelensky\'s hometown of Kryvyi Rih reported fresh Russian strikes Thursday after attacks damaged a dam and saw dozens of homes flooded.\nIn the eastern Donetsk region, which has been partially controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014, fresh shelling killed two civilians and left another 13 wounded. In the Ukrainian-held Donetsk town of Bakhmut, AFP journalists said streets were deserted and the sound of nearby artillery was audible in the town\'s centre.\nFlames were still licking a residential building hit by Russian strikes overnight and plumes of thick smoke were rising as firefighters battled the blaze. At the meeting in Uzbekistan, Putin blasted attempts to create a \"unipolar world\" and praised China\'s stance on the conflict.\n\"We highly appreciate the balanced position of our Chinese friends in connection with the Ukrainian crisis,\" Putin told Xi. Beijing has not explicitly endorsed Moscow\'s invasion but it has steadily built economic and strategic ties with Russia over the six months of the war.\n', 'https://france24.com/en/europe/20220915-eu-s-von-der-leyen-vows-unfaltering-support-for-ukraine-on-kyiv-visit', 'France24/2022/9/EU_to_support_Ukraine_for_as_long_as_it_takes_von_der_Leyen_says.png'),

But on Saturday, when Russia abandoned its main bastion in the northeastern region, marking its worst defeat since the early days of the invasion, the embarrassing reversal was too big to ignore.  “They really didn’t expect this. They didn’t know what to say and they didn’t receive information from the Kremlin on how to react,” explained Alexandra Filippenko, a Russian political scientist now based in Lithuania, on FRANCE 24’s “The Debate” show on Monday.\nSince Russia launched its invasion in Ukraine on February 24, Russian media pundits have strenuously backed the “special military operation”, with commentators trying to outdo each other in their support for President Vladimir Putin.\nOn Sunday night, there were still displays of the old rhetoric on the NTV talk show following Nadezhdin’s stunning takedown of Russian military strategy. “Non-comrade Nadezhdin, I again urge you to watch your language when you talk about ‘colonial wars’, even in passing,” warned parliamentarian Alexander Kazakov.\nBut Kazakov’s warning sounded more defensive than fiery when he went on to explain that Russia was actually taking on the West in the “broader theatre of war”. “A global war is under way, this is just a fragment of it,” he said before Nadezhdin shot back, “I hope a global war doesn’t start. But if it does, the balance of power won’t be in our favour.”\nA rout turns ‘strategic withdrawal’\nThe feisty on-air exchanges were a departure from the rabble-rousing seen on Russian TV stations over the past few months. Even the Kremlin’s most vociferous defender, Dmitry Kiselyov – dubbed “Putin’s mouthpiece” – was forced to adopt a sombre tone on his prime-time Sunday night show on the state-run Russia-1 network.\n\"A most difficult week on the front,\" admitted Kiselyov, opening his show. Under a studio backdrop that proclaimed, “Regrouping”, Kiselyov admitted Russian forces had abandoned “previously liberated settlements\".\nKiselyov’s discourse on its losses in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region mirrored Moscow’s talking points following the Russian pullout in late March from the Kyiv region after the assault on the Ukrainian capital was ground down by fierce resistance.\n\"They generally use euphemisms to minimise the importance of what is happening and suggest that everything is going as planned,\" explained Maxim Alyukov, a Russian media specialist at King\'s College London, in an interview with FRANCE 24.\nTV stations and newspapers talk about a \"strategic withdrawal to help defend the Donbas, which is reminiscent of the way the failure to take Kyiv was justified at the beginning of the war\", said Jaroslava Barbieri, a specialist on Russia at the University of Birmingham.\nThe idea of a carefully planned \"strategic withdrawal\" was taken up by Russian print media and wire services even as they acknowledge that Russian troops have been pushed back by Ukrainian forces.\nThe RIA Novosti news agency, for instance, said Russian troops were forced to retreat since the Ukrainians were much more numerous due to the contribution of \"foreign mercenaries\". At the same time, RIA Novosti was also busy reporting a planned “strategic withdrawal” from the Kharkiv region.\n\"The Russian media, which is subservient to the government, has started to use several contradictory explanations at the same time. This is in line with their traditional propaganda strategy, which is not to inform but to confuse,\" explained Vera Tolz, a Russian media specialist at the University of Manchester.\nBlame the separatist republics, not Moscow\nWhile the lightning Ukrainian gains caught Russian media outlets by surprise, the editorial line in several newsrooms quickly fell back on standard operating procedures in the face of the unexpected and unforeseen.\nFrom the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, where she was monitoring the Sunday prime-time shows, Filippenko noticed a new trend.\nOn Channel One, Russia’s oldest and largest state-controlled TV station, Filippenko noted that the battlefield setbacks were being pinned on Donetsk and Luhansk, parts of the eastern Donbas region that were proclaimed independent republics by Russia-backed separatists in 2014.\n“They constantly emphasised that it’s the Donetsk and Luhansk republics that are at war with Ukraine,” she explained. “In other words, it seems like Russia has nothing to do with it. So that’s how they’re trying to spin it.”\nIt’s the advisers, not Putin\nThe spin included re-inviting guests who were mildly critical of the invasion in its early days and had subsequently disappeared from Russian screens.\nBut even critics like Nadezhdin, who shocked Russian media monitors with his forthright critique of Moscow’s strategy in Ukraine, stuck to a familiar pattern.\nBefore his headline-grabbing takedown of Russia’s “colonial war methods” on NTV, the former opposition lawmaker was careful to blame “the people who convinced President Putin” that the “special operation” would be fast and effective. “These people really set all of us up,” he declared.\n\"Most of them explain that if the conflict is not going as planned, it is because Vladimir Putin has been badly advised. In other words, they are preparing the ground so that the government can designate scapegoats to punish,\" said Tolz.\nA notable adherent of the “blame everyone but Putin” school was Ramzan Kadyrov, the Moscow-backed leader of the Russian region of Chechnya, who publicly criticised the Russian defence ministry on Sunday for what he called “mistakes” that made the Ukrainian blitz possible.\nIn a post on the Telegram social media platform, Kadyrov said he \"would have to speak with the country\'s leader to explain what is really happening on the ground\". It was the Chechen leader’s way of suggesting that Putin was not responsible for the situation because he was badly advised.\n“We all know that Kadyrov is always firmly behind Putin, and he always supports the Kremlin,” said Filippenko. “So maybe this is his way of getting closer to the Kremlin, because he recently said that it’s time for him to leave Chechnya, it’s time for him to stop being the head of Chechnya. So maybe he just did it to get closer to Moscow.”\nWhile the likes of Kadyrov strategise on how best to profit from the latest battlefield losses, Ukrainian officials stress that, in the end, Russia is destined to lose the messaging war.\n“Fundamentally, getting your message across depends on having truth on your side,” said Alexander Rodnyansky, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, on FRANCE 24’s “The Debate” show on Monday. “You can manipulate, you can think about the tactics, the strategies, the communication techniques that you apply as much as you want. But as long as it’s based on some fallacy, on some lie, you’re not going to have permanent, long-lasting success at convincing anybody. And we have success at convincing the world, and our partners, not because we’re so effective at using some strategies, but because we have truth on our side: We’re defending our country.”\n(Sebastien Seibt contributed reporting to this article.)\n', 'https://france24.com/en/europe/20220914-russian-media-grapples-with-covering-ukrainian-blitz-%E2%80%93-without-earning-the-kremlin-s-ire', 'France24/2022/9/Russian_media_grapples_with_covering_Ukrainian_blitz__without_earning_the_Kremlins_ire.png'),
(63, 3, '2022-09-13 18:09:00', 'With its counteroffensive in the east Ukraine wants to prove victory is possible', 'The Ukrainian army is continuing its counter-offensive in the east, claiming on Monday to have recaptured 20 settlements from Russian forces in just 24 hours. For Tetyana Ogarkova of the Ukraine Crisis Media Center NGO, the advance does not constitute a military turning point but has reinforced Ukrainian hopes of an eventual victory over Moscow.\nThe Ukrainian army has launched a lightening counter-offensive that caught Russia\'s defences off guard. Ukrainian forces have been accumulating military successes in the east of the country since September 7, a reconquest that now extends from Vovchansk in the northeast of the Kharkiv region (close to the Russian border) to the strategic town of Izium some 150km to the south.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday that Ukraine had retaken 6,000 square kilometres (2,320 square miles) from Russian control since the start of the month.\nA senior US military official on Monday confirmed that Russian forces had “largely ceded their gains” around Kharkiv and said Russian soldiers appeared to be retreating over the border back into Russia.\nFRANCE 24 spoke to Tetyana Ogarkova, a journalist in charge of the international desk at the Ukraine Crisis Media Center, to find out what this recent military success means for Ukraine.\nHow can we explain this military breakthrough? After announcing a southern counter-offensive in early September, was the Ukrainian army hoping to have the element of surprise in the east?\nTetyana Ogarkova: Indeed, for months, military experts have been talking about preparations for a counter-offensive in the south – whereas now we see that the operation to retake parts of the Kharkiv region was meticulously planned. The Ukrainian army followed a very precise route, passing through Balakliya, Kupiansk and then Izium to regain control of the railways used by Moscow to transport supplies to its troops in the south. The operation’s objective went beyond the liberation of the Kharkiv region – it was actually aimed at weakening the Russian troops in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n>> Ukrainian forces threaten Russian supply lines after lightning advance in east\nTo do this, the Ukrainians changed their communication strategy. Official statements about the situation on the ground have become much more evasive and they have restricted journalists\' access to the southern and eastern fronts. This adds to the \"fog of war\".\nYet despite this careful preparation, the scale and speed of this reconquest surprised even the military itself, which had expected more resistance from Russian troops.\nThe Security Council of the Russian Federation, chaired by President Vladimir Putin, opted for an organised withdrawal, preferring to save its troops in the area. The scenario was similar to the withdrawal from the suburbs of Kyiv in late March-early April that happened when Russian troops, semi-encircled, no longer had the possibility to advance.\nIs the city of Kharkiv, which was one of Moscow\'s main targets when the Russian operation was launched, now better protected?\nUnfortunately, it is not, because this Russian withdrawal does not change its bombing capacity. On Sunday evening, Russian missiles hit an electricity station, causing a blackout in the whole region, including in the Kharkiv metro, where passengers were stranded.\nKharkiv is only 25 kilometres from the border, so it is very easy for the Russians to bomb the city using modern artillery but also with Soviet-era equipment, which it possesses in large quantities, such as the Uragan (hurricane) multiple-launch rocket system or S-300 surface-to-air missiles. They were initially intended for anti-aircraft defence but can also be used for ground attacks.\nThe Russians tried to take the city in March but did not succeed and abandoned the plan. However, they are continuing their strategy of terror, which consists of bombing it relentlessly to make life impossible for the inhabitants who refused to leave.\nDoes this recapture of much of the Kharkiv region mark a turning point in the conflict?\nIn my opinion, it is not a real turning point but rather a strategic victory. Ukrainian forces are demonstrating here that they are capable of carrying out impressive large-scale operations. In less than a week, they have taken back more territory than the Russians have conquered over the course of the last four months.\nWith this counter-offensive, Ukraine wants to prove that victory is possible. It shows that it is able to use Western weapons effectively and that additional increases in arms deliveries may determine the outcome of the war.\nMeanwhile, Russia is trying to convince the West that the price of involvement in Ukraine is too high given the energy crisis now affecting Europe. It is also falling back on the \"Almighty Russia\" narrative – widely repeated by state media – which aims to convince Russians that they cannot possibly lose to Ukraine since they are better-equipped and a nuclear power.\nIt is true that the balance of power remains largely in Russia\'s favour, both in terms of troop numbers and arms, despite Western support. This is why Kyiv decided to strike hard before a harsh winter that could prove decisive on the battlefield.\n', 'https://france24.com/en/europe/20220913-with-its-counter-offensive-in-the-east-ukraine-wants-to-prove-victory-is-possible', 'France24/2022/9/With_its_counteroffensive_in_the_east_Ukraine_wants_to_prove_victory_is_possible.png'),
